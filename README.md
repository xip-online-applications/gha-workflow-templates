## Usage
See inside each workflow directory for more information on how to use the workflow. Each workflow has a `README.md`.
You can use each workflow with `uses: xip-online-applications/gha-workflow-templates/{WORKFLOW}@{VERSION or main}`.
See the following example:

```yaml
name: 'Test git-crypt-unlock'
on:
    push:
jobs:
    job:

        steps:
            - name: Checkout repository
              uses: actions/checkout@v4

            - name: Git-crypt unlock
              uses: xip-online-applications/gha-workflow-templates/git-crypt-unlock@main
              with:
